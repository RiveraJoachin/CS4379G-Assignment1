    "This notebook analyzes the Netflix Movies and TV Shows dataset to look into trends in the streaming service's content library. Specifically, it examines how the number of titles added to Netflix has evolved over time and compares movies and TV series based on their length and content ratings.\n",
    "## Data Dictionary\n",
    "The Netflix titles dataset contains the following columns:\n",
    "- `show_id`: Unique identifier for each title\n",
    "- `type`: Indicates whether the title is a Movie or TV Show\n",
    "- `title`: Name of the movie or TV show\n",
    "- `director`: Director(s) of the title\n",
    "- `cast`: Main cast members\n",
    "- `country`: Country or countries of production\n",
    "- `date_added`: Date the title was added to Netflix\n",
    "- `release_year`: Year the title was originally released\n",
    "- `rating`: Content rating (e.g., PG, PG-13, TV-MA)\n",
    "- `duration`: Runtime in minutes for Movies or number of seasons for TV Shows\n",
    "- `listed_in`: Genre(s) or category labels\n",
    "- `description`: Brief description of the title\n",
    "### Columns Used in This Analysis\n",
    "This analysis focuses on the following columns:\n",
    "- `type`\n",
    "- `date_added`\n",
    "- `release_year`\n",
    "- `rating`\n",
    "- `duration`\n",
    "## Queries: \n",
    "1. How many new titles have been added to Netflix over time, broken down by year?\n",
    "2. Is the average runtime or distribution of ratings different for TV shows and movies?"
